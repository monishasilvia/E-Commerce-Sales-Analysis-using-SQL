E-Commerce Sales Analysis using SQL

Project Overview:

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL on an e-commerce sales dataset. 
The goal is to analyze customer orders, product sales, cancellations, and revenue trends using MySQL queries.

Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of 100 rows representing e-commerce transactions with the following key columns:

order_id - Unique identifier for each order

order_date - Date when the order was placed

customer_id - Unique customer identifier

product_id - Unique product identifier

category - Product category

quantity - Number of items ordered

total_amount - Total sales amount for the order

status - Order status (Delivered, Canceled, Returned)
